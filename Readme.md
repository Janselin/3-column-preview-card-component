## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design


### What I learned

First of all I've practiced a lot with Flexbox/@media which it was a bit difficult for me to understand at first.
Also I had to learn Github/Github Pages to actually upload this solution. 


### Continued development
I'm Looking forward to keep learning about CSS and JS very soon.
Also learn more about Responsive Web design, since this one was my very first attemp to it.
